# 8080
Intel 8080 Emulator for the Taito Space Invaders game 

A work in progress.

Dependencies:
1) Space Invaders ROM has to be located in the same directory as the executable. The files must be named as follows:
	invaders_h.rom
	invaders_g.rom
	invaders_f.rom
	invaders_e.rom
	

Built in GO with lots of help from the following resources:
